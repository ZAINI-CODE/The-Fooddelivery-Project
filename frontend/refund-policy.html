      <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-meta">Last updated: January 1, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Order Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        You may cancel your order before it is confirmed by the restaurant. Once
        the restaurant has confirmed and started preparing your order, cancellation
        may not be possible.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Customer-Initiated Cancellation</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish to cancel your order, please do so immediately through the
        order tracking page or by contacting our support team. Cancellations made
        within 5 minutes of order placement are typically approved automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Restaurant-Initiated Cancellation</h3>
      <p>
        In rare cases, the restaurant may need to cancel your order due to
        unavailability of items or other unforeseen circumstances. In such cases,
        you will receive a full refund to your original payment method.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You may be eligible for a refund in the following situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Order cancelled before restaurant confirmation</li>
        <li>Restaurant cancels the order</li>
        <li>Incorrect or missing items in your order</li>
        <li>Food quality issues (spoiled, cold, or not as described)</li>
        <li>Significant delivery delay beyond the estimated time</li>
        <li>Order never delivered</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are processed based on your original payment method:
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Cash on Delivery</h3>
      <p>
        If you paid via Cash on Delivery and are eligible for a refund, the amount
        will be credited to your account wallet which can be used for future
        orders, or transferred to your bank account upon request.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Online Payment (Card/Wallet)</h3>
      <p>
        For online payments, refunds are processed back to your original payment
        method within 5-7 business days. The exact time may vary depending on your
        bank or payment provider.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Partial Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        In cases of missing or incorrect items, we may offer a partial refund
        corresponding to the value of the affected items, rather than a full
        refund.
      </p>
